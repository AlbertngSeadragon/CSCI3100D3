## Web app

StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

### Frontend
The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

### Backend

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.
